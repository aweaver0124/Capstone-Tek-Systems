# Vax Track
This application was designed with pet owners in mind. This app allows you to include all of your pets in one location and store the vaccinations they received. It also securely stores user information.

Features:
Login/signup functionality
Add individual pets to your user profile.
See a list of all pets, and see individual pets and their information and vaccinations.
Add a vaccination to indivual pets.
See all of your user information.
Update user information.

Features to add in the future:
Implement a map that shows vet clinics in the user's state.
Delete vaccinations and pets.
Include more of a variety in terms of pets. Currently only includes dogs and cats, but it would be nice to include other animals.
Image file upload for pets.

Roadblocks: 
I had difficulties with image uploading. I was unable to implement this feature and hope to include it in the future.
Minor styling issues. I had some difficulties figuring out exactly how I wanted to style certain pages in my project.
